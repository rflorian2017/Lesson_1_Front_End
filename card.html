			<p>Typically green with yellow colors, the budgie lives in Australia, but has been domesticized and can be found all arround the world in captivity. The male has blue nostrils and the female has brownish ones. But when they are young, the gender can not be distinguished. Their lifespan depends on the nutrition, the comfort, the exercise and the attention it gets. But, a fact is sure. They color the life of their owners, also by the sounde they make.</p>
